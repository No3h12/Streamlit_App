Data Insights Explorer
Welcome to the Data Insights Explorer! This project allows you to upload datasets and interact with them through natural language queries using an AI-powered assistant Using RAG!. It provides various tools for data preprocessing, exploration, and visualization.

Features
Upload and Preview Data: Supports CSV and Excel files with automatic data validation.
Interactive Chat: Ask questions about your dataset and get AI-powered responses.
Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values, outliers, duplicates, and perform column operations.
Handle categorical columns with One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding.
Analyze columns with unique values and visualize their distributions.
Data Visualization: Generate various charts and perform correlation analysis.
Download Processed Data: Download the modified dataset after processing.

Data Preprocessing Features
Handle Categorical Columns
The handle_categorical function allows you to handle categorical columns using the following methods:

One-Hot Encoding: Creates binary columns for each category.
Label Encoding: Converts categories to numerical values.
Keep Original: Maintains the original categorical format.
Handle Duplicates
The handle_duplicates function provides methods to manage duplicate rows:

Keep First: Keep the first occurrence of duplicate rows.
Keep Last: Keep the last occurrence of duplicate rows.
Drop All: Remove all duplicate rows.
Handle Missing Values
The handle_missing_values function provides methods to handle missing values in the dataset:

Fill with Mean: Fill missing values with the mean of the column.
Fill with Median: Fill missing values with the median of the column.
Fill with Mode: Fill missing values with the mode of the column.
Drop Rows: Remove rows containing missing values.
Random Imputation: Randomly impute missing values with existing values in the column.
Handle Outliers
The handle_outliers function provides methods to handle outliers in numerical columns:

Remove Outliers: Remove rows containing outliers.
Replace with Mean: Replace outliers with the column mean.
Replace with Median: Replace outliers with the column median.
Clip Values: Cap outliers at the boundary values.
Show Unique Values
The show_unique_values function allows you to analyze columns with fewer than 50 unique values, providing:

Distribution: View value counts and percentages.
Details: Detailed information including missing values and basic statistics.
Visualization: Visualize the distribution of values using histograms or bar charts.
